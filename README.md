# React-Notion-Share-Widget
<h2>A notion share widget</h2>
<p>It's  a share widget where users can invite groups and other members and can give access to them</p>
<p> Here I have used React hooks to build this application. </p>
<p>With react context provider and useREDUCER HOOK the global state is managed</p>
<p>For Sharing Modal React.forwardRef and useImperativehandle hook helps to access the modal reference of child component from the parent component </p>
<p>Used a custom hook to mange the side effect i.e to fetch data from remote server </p>
